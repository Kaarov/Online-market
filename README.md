 # Booking 
 In order to book you should just click the day which one do you want to book, but you can't click gray(disable) or red(booked).
 # About 4 different colors:
 1) GRAY -> That time will be maybe lessons or important event and the admin will controll all of them.
 2) RED -> That time booked by someone. You can't click that one.
 3) GREEN -> This is what you booked before. Others will see your book red.
 4) WHITE -> It's able and you can click and book time.
